## 💻 Project

The project is a Rubik's cube e-commerce.

Why Rubik's cube? Another thing that I like to do besides programming is competitive speedcubing, so I thought it would be a good idea to a programming project.

The application consumes the Stripe API to get the products and uses Next.js API Routes to deal with the product checkout. Also, it uses Next Auth to deal with social authentication with Google.

The Stripe API data is consumed using getStaticProps function, which makes dynamic data to be static.

Chakra UI was used to develop the UI.

- Static site generation;
- Social authentication;
- API Routes;
- Declarative UI (Chakra UI);
- Component separation;
